# Security Scanner

Repman's built in **Security Scanner** automatically checks whether your package uses dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.

It looks for `composer.lock` files in your package repository (supports **multi lock** packages) and reads dependencies list.

It uses [FriendsOfPHP Security Advisories](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories) database which is kept up to date by a cron job (in two-hour intervals).

## In case of vulnerability detection

- `WARNING` status will appear in packages list
- **email** will be sent to all members of organization (this can be turned off in [user profile](/docs/user-profile))

Scan is performed every time the package is successfully **synchronized** but you can always trigger manual scan using menu:
