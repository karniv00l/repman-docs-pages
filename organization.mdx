# Organization

Organizations are used to group packages. Each user can belong to an unlimited number of organizations. At the moment, each organization can have one owner. After logging in to your account, you can select your organization from the selection menu to the right side of the logo:

![Choose organization](/docs/static/articles/organization/choose.png)

In order to make packages available in a given organization, an authorization token is needed. By default, the token is automatically generated during the organization setup.

You can view the token in the overview tab of the organization, and on the list of tokens:

![Overview](/docs/static/articles/organization/overview.png)

You can generate any number of tokens for your organization in the **Tokens** tab, where you can also regenerate and delete them. This allows you to efficiently share your packets with the selected entity.
